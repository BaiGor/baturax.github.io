# Adele - Set Fire to the Rain

I let it fall, my heart, <br>
**- <br>**
And as it fell, you rose claim it <br>
**- <br>**
It was dark and I was over <br>
**- <br>**
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me <br>
**- **

My hands, they're strong <br>
**- <br>**
But my knees were far too weak <br>
**- <br>**
To stand in your arms <br>
**- <br>**
Without falling to your feet <br>
**- **

But there's a side to you <br>
**- <br>**
That I never knew, never knew <br>
**- <br>**
All the things you'd say <br>
**- <br>**
They were never true, never true, <br>
**- <br>**
And the games you play <br>
**- <br>**
You would always win, always win <br>
**- **

But I set fire to the rain, <br>
**- <br>**
Watched it pour as I touched your face, <br>
**- <br>**
Well, it burned while I cried, <br>
**- <br>**
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name! <br>
**- **

When I lay with you <br>
**- <br>**
I could stay there <br>
**- <br>**
Close my eyes <br>
**- <br>**
Feel you here forever <br>
**- <br>**
You and me together <br>
**- <br>**
Nothing gets better <br>
**- **

'Cause there's a side to you <br>
**- <br>**
That I never knew, never knew, <br>
**- <br>**
All the things you'd say, <br>
**- <br>**
They were never true, never true, <br>
**- <br>**
And the games you'd play <br>
**- <br>**
You would always win, always win <br>
**- **

But I set fire to the rain, <br>
**- <br>**
Watched it pour as I touched your face, <br>
**- <br>**
Well, it burn while I cried, <br>
**- <br>**
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name! <br>
**- **

I set fire to the rain <br>
**- <br>**
And I threw us into the flames <br>
**- <br>**
When it fell something dark <br>
**- <br>**
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time! <br>
**- **

Sometimes I wake up by the door, <br>
**- <br>**
That heart you caught must be waiting for you <br>
**- <br>**
Even now when we're already over <br>
**- <br>**
I can't help myself from looking for you <br>
**- **

I set fire to the rain, <br>
**- <br>**
Watched it pour as I touched your face, <br>
**- <br>**
Well, it burned while I cried <br>
**- <br>**
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name <br>
**- **

I set fire to the rain, <br>
**- <br>**
And I threw us into the flames <br>
**- <br>**
When it fell something died... <br>
**- <br>**
'Cause I knew that was the last time <br>
**- <br>**
The last time, oh, oh! <br>
**- **

Let it burn <br>
**- <br>**
Let it burn <br>
**- <br>**
Let it burn <br>
**- <br>**
