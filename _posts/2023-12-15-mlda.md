# MGMT - Little Dark Age Türkçe Çeviri


Breathing in the dark, lying on its side

The ruins of the day painted with a scar <br>
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try

The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time

Oh-oh, forgiving who you are, for what you stand to gain <br>
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away <br>
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded <br>
Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby

The carvings on the face say they find it hard

And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise

The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Oh-oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange <br>
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away <br>
If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone <br>
Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange <br>
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away <br>
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone <br>
Horrified on the stage, my little dark age <br>
Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come <br>
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind <br>
Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns <br>
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run <br>
If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge <br>
Bring a stone, all the rage, my little dark age <br>
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange <br>
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away <br>
If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone <br>
Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age <br>
All alone, open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age <br>
